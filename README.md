<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

I built this API because i was not satisfied with other other api's found on the internet
due to the limitations.
I needed to be able to create, update and remove records from database.
!!!<strong>WARNING</strong>!!! As it's still work in progress!

### Demo
At the moment you can add new products, update and delete those but you need to be authorized.
Just head to the login page.
<strong>Login: test_user</strong>
<strong>Password: test_user12345</strong>
You can use as you like but don't overstay your wlcome :)
[Demo](https://distracted-easley-826ab7.netlify.app/)

### Built With
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
* [Dj-Rest-Auth](https://github.com/jazzband/dj-rest-auth)
